/**
 * Subject - a plain in-memory representation of one subject's data.
 *
 * This class deliberately has no behaviour: no enrol()/withdraw() methods,
 * no capacity checks, and no locking. Implementing those rules correctly
 * is the actual point of this assignment, so it is left entirely to you.
 *
 * enrolledStudentIds is a LinkedHashSet: this gives you O(1) membership
 * checks (for DUPLICATE_ENROLMENT / NOT_ENROLLED) while preserving the
 * order students were enrolled in, which is a reasonable default for the
 * enrolledStudentIds list returned by QUERY. You are free to change the
 * underlying data structure if you prefer a different one, as long as
 * your server behaves as the Functional Requirements section describes.
 *
 * This class is NOT thread-safe on its own. Any code that reads or
 * mutates a Subject concurrently from multiple threads must use your own
 * locking to do so safely - that is true whether you keep this class as
 * given or modify it.
